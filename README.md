Hi, my name is Jack Davidson and I am a programmer in Austin, Texas. I enjoy
computer science & mathematics. I have a strong passion for learning and I am a
strong believer in the growth mindset.

## programming languages
- C
- POSIX-compatible shell
- python
	- django

## latest project
[personal website and blog](https://github.com/jack-davidson/jackdavidson)

My lastest project, my personal website and blog, is an extension of my
previously made static website and I added templating and a database so blogs
can be written and viewed. The personal website and blog is not yet hosted
so the [old static website](https://jack-davidson.github.io/site/) is what
I am using now. Once I get my personal website and blog hosted, that will
be my primary website and I will take down the old site. The source code for
the old site is available [here](https://github.com/jack-davidson/site).
