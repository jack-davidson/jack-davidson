Hi, my name is Jack Davidson and I am a web developer &
programmer based in Austin, Texas. I enjoy computer science
& mathematics. I have a strong passion for learning
and I am a strong believer in the growth mindset.

## programming languages
I program daily in C and POSIX shell. I also have experience
in web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, and
vanilla javascript. My backend langauge and toolset of choice
is python plus (django for more complex projects) or (flask
for simpler APIs).
