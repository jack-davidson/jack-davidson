# Jack Davidson ([website](https://jack-davidson.github.io/site/))
Hi, my name is Jack Davidson and I am a programmer in Austin, Texas.
I enjoy computer science & mathematics. I have a strong passion for
learning and I am a strong believer in the growth mindset.

## programming languages
I program daily in C and POSIX shell. I also have experience in web development
using technologies like HTML, CSS, and javascript. My backend langauge and
toolset of choice is python plus (django for more complex projects) or (flask
for simpler APIs).

## latest project
[personal website and blog](https://github.com/jack-davidson/jackdavidson)


My lastest project, my personal website and blog, is an extension of my
previously made static website and I added templating and a database so blogs
can be written and viewed. The personal website and blog is not yet hosted
so the [old static website](https://jack-davidson.github.io/site/) is what
I am using now. Once I get my personal website and blog hosted, that will
be my primary website and I will take down the old site. The source code for
the old site is available [here](https://github.com/jack-davidson/site).
