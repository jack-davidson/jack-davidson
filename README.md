# Jack Davidson ([website](https://jack-davidson.github.io/site/))
Hi, my name is Jack Davidson and I am a web developer &
programmer based in Austin, Texas. I enjoy computer science
& mathematics. I have a strong passion for learning
and I am a strong believer in the growth mindset.

## programming languages
I program daily in C and POSIX shell. I also have experience
in web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, and
vanilla javascript. My backend langauge and toolset of choice
is python plus (django for more complex projects) or (flask
for simpler APIs).

## latest project
[personal website and blog](https://github.com/jack-davidson/jackdavidson)
<br>
My lastest project, my personal website and blog, is an extension of my
previously made static website and I added templating and a database so blogs
can be written and viewed. The personal website and blog is not yet hosted
so the [old static website](https://jack-davidson.github.io/site/) is what
I am using now. Once I get my personal website and blog hosted, that will
be my primary website and I will take down the old site. The source code for
the old site is available [here](https://github.com/jack-davidson/site).
